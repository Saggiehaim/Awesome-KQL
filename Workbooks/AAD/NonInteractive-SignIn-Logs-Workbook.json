Try signing in again. |\r\n| AADSTS50199 | CmsiInterrupt - For security reasons, user confirmation is required for this request.  Because this is an \"interaction_required\" error, the client should do interactive auth.  This occurs because a system webview has been used to request a token for a native application - the user must be prompted to ask if this was actually the app they meant to sign into. To avoid this prompt, the redirect URI should be part of the following safe list: <br />http://<br />https://<br />msauth://(iOS only)<br />msauthv2://(iOS only)<br />chrome-extension:// (desktop Chrome browser only) |\r\n| AADSTS51000 | RequiredFeatureNotEnabled - The feature is disabled. |\r\n| AADSTS51001 | DomainHintMustbePresent - Domain hint must be present with on-premises security identifier or on-premises UPN. |\r\n| AADSTS1000104| XCB2BResourceCloudNotAllowedOnIdentityTenant - Resource cloud {resourceCloud} isn't allowed on identity tenant {identityTenant}. {resourceCloud} - cloud instance which owns the resource. {identityTenant} - is the tenant where signing-in identity is originated from. |\r\n| AADSTS51004 | UserAccountNotInDirectory - The user account doesn’t exist in the directory. |\r\n| AADSTS51005 | TemporaryRedirect - Equivalent to HTTP status 307, which indicates that the requested information is located at the URI specified in the location header.

Have the user use a domain joined device. |\r\n| AADSTS53002 | ApplicationUsedIsNotAnApprovedApp - The app used isn't an approved app for Conditional Access.
